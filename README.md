Flask for Students
====

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a great server-side web development microframework for Python based on 
Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. I like it because it's lightweight and flexible. When I'm teaching
Python and  web development to new students, I find Flask easy for students to pickup quickly without 
obscuring the underlying web and HTTP mechanics. This Flask tutorial is inspired by the superb 
[DjangoGirls tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) (which I've also used successfully with students)
with the hope that people who want to learn web development in Python will find a useful starting point.
